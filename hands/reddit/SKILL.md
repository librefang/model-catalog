# Reddit Management Expert Knowledge

## Reddit API Reference

### Authentication (OAuth2 Script App)

Reddit API requires OAuth2 authentication for all endpoints.

**Step 1: Get access token (app-only / client_credentials)**:
```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/access_token" \
  -u "$REDDIT_CLIENT_ID:$REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
  -A "LibreFang Reddit Hand/1.0"
```
Response: `{"access_token": "...", "token_type": "bearer", "expires_in": 86400, "scope": "*"}`

> **Note:** `client_credentials` provides app-only access. Most read endpoints (listing posts, fetching comments, searching) work normally. Posting and commenting use the app's identity. For full user-level actions (e.g., voting, managing subscriptions), the more complex OAuth2 authorization code flow is required.

**All subsequent requests** must include:
```
Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN
User-Agent: LibreFang Reddit Hand/1.0
```

### Core Endpoints

**Get subreddit posts (hot)**:
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -A "LibreFang Reddit Hand/1.0" \
  "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT/hot?limit=25"
```

**Get subreddit posts (new)**:
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -A "LibreFang Reddit Hand/1.0" \
  "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT/new?limit=25"
```

**Get subreddit posts (rising)**:
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -A "LibreFang Reddit Hand/1.0" \
  "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT/rising?limit=25"
```

**Submit a new post (self/text)**:
```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -A "LibreFang Reddit Hand/1.0" \
  -d "sr=SUBREDDIT&kind=self&title=TITLE&text=BODY" \
  "https://oauth.reddit.com/api/submit"
```

**Submit a link post**:
```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -A "LibreFang Reddit Hand/1.0" \
  -d "sr=SUBREDDIT&kind=link&title=TITLE&url=URL" \
  "https://oauth.reddit.com/api/submit"
```

**Post a comment**:
```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -A "LibreFang Reddit Hand/1.0" \
  -d "thing_id=FULLNAME&text=COMMENT_TEXT" \
  "https://oauth.reddit.com/api/comment"
```
Note: `thing_id` is the fullname of the parent (e.g., `t3_abc123` for a post, `t1_def456` for a comment).

**Get comments on a post**:
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -A "LibreFang Reddit Hand/1.0" \
  "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT/comments/POST_ID?limit=50"
```

**Get user info (self)**:
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -A "LibreFang Reddit Hand/1.0" \
  "https://oauth.reddit.com/api/v1/me"
```

**Search within a subreddit**:
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -A "LibreFang Reddit Hand/1.0" \
  "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT/search?q=QUERY&restrict_sr=on&limit=25"
```

### Rate Limits
| Type | Limit | Window |
|------|-------|--------|

| With app-only auth | 30 requests | 1 minute |
| Posting | ~1 post | 10 minutes (varies by karma) |
| Commenting | ~1 comment | varies by karma |

Always check response headers:
- `x-ratelimit-remaining`: Requests remaining
- `x-ratelimit-reset`: Seconds until reset
- `x-ratelimit-used`: Requests used this window

## Reddit Content Strategy

### Understanding Subreddit Culture

Before posting in any subreddit:
1. Read the subreddit rules (sidebar/about page)
2. Observe top posts of the past month for style cues
3. Note common formatting (titles, flair usage, post length)
4. Understand what gets upvoted vs downvoted
5. Check if the subreddit allows self-promotion or links

### Common Subreddit Rule Patterns

Different subreddits enforce very different rules. Here are real examples:

**r/python** — Strict self-promotion rules:
- 10:1 ratio: For every self-promotional post, you must have 10 non-promotional contributions
- No link-only posts — must include discussion or explanation
- Required flair for post type (Help, Discussion, News, etc.)

**r/AskReddit** — Strict formatting:
- Title must be a question ending with "?"
- No text body allowed (title only)
- No yes/no questions — must invite discussion

**r/science** — Academic rigor:
- Links must go to peer-reviewed research or reputable news covering research
- No anecdotal claims, personal opinions, or speculation
- Comments that don't cite sources may be removed

**r/programming** — Anti-spam:
- No "What language should I learn?" posts
- No job postings or hiring threads
- Blog posts must have substantial technical content, not marketing

**Key rule categories to parse from any subreddit:**
```
1. Post format: title-only? text required? link required? flair required?
2. Self-promotion: allowed? ratio requirement? disclosure needed?
3. Content restrictions: banned topics? required sources? minimum quality?
4. Account requirements: minimum age? minimum karma? approved submitters only?
5. Engagement rules: must respond to comments? no drive-by posting?
```

### Toxicity & Moderation Signals

Before posting or replying, scan for these red flags:
- **Thread locked or removed** — moderators already intervened, do NOT engage
- **Controversial marker** (†) on comments — indicates divisive topic, tread carefully
- **OP deleted account** — thread may be abandoned or toxic
- **Heavily downvoted parent** — replying to a -10 comment rarely goes well
- **Personal attacks in thread** — disengage entirely, do not escalate

When generating replies, NEVER:
- Take sides in heated debates — provide balanced perspectives
- Use sarcasm or irony — easily misread in text
- Correct grammar/spelling unless directly relevant to the discussion
- Reply to comments that are clearly trolling or bad-faith

### Post Types That Perform Well

| Type | Best For | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Question posts | Engagement | "What's your approach to X?" |
| How-to guides | Authority | "Step-by-step guide to X" |
| Data/Analysis | Credibility | "I analyzed 1000 X, here's what I found" |
| Story/Experience | Connection | "After 5 years of X, here's what I learned" |
| Resource lists | Utility | "Curated list of the best X resources" |
| Discussion starters | Community | "Unpopular opinion: X is better than Y" |

### Title Writing Best Practices

- Be specific: "How I reduced build times by 80% with Cargo caching" beats "Build optimization tip"
- Use numbers when possible: "5 things I wish I knew..."
- Ask genuine questions: "Has anyone tried X for Y?"
- Avoid clickbait -- Redditors penalize it
- Match the subreddit's tone (formal for r/science, casual for r/programming)

### Comment Engagement

Good replies:
- Answer the question directly, then add context
- Share personal experience with specifics
- Provide sources for claims
- Ask thoughtful follow-up questions
- Acknowledge when someone makes a good point

Bad replies (avoid):
- Generic "Great post!" or "This!"
- Unsolicited self-promotion
- Pedantic corrections without substance
- Sarcasm that could be misread
- Argumentative tone

## Reddit Etiquette (Reddiquette)

### Do
- Vote based on quality, not opinion
- Read the full post before replying
- Consider the subreddit's purpose
- Use appropriate flair
- Be constructive in criticism
- Credit original sources

### Don't
- Spam the same content across subreddits
- Use alt accounts to upvote yourself
- Post personal information (doxxing)
- Harass or bully other users
- Engage in vote manipulation
- Post low-effort content repeatedly

---

## Safety & Compliance

### Content Guidelines
NEVER post:
- Personal information about anyone (doxxing)
- Harassment or bullying content
- Spam or repetitive self-promotion
- Misleading claims presented as fact
- Content that violates subreddit-specific rules
- Illegal content or content encouraging illegal activity

### Account Health
Monitor account standing:
- Keep post-to-comment ratio healthy (more comments than posts)
- Build karma organically through genuine engagement
- Avoid posting too frequently (triggers spam filters)
- Diversify activity across multiple subreddits
